### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Marlon!
I'm a 18-year-old back-end developer (but, I end up doing front-end/web development and devops sometimes) from the Brazil. As languages I use most are PHP, Python, Lua (I love Lua), recently I am learning functional programming together with Elixir and I am also learning Go.

You will find in this Github: some exercises, bots for discord, codes for robots in Minecraft and random codes from my mind.
